    Malindi Lankatilleke was born in Sri Lanka and lived in various countries throughout her life.
     Shortly after she was born, her family moved to Sudan for her father’s job at the UN, though 
     they shortly returned. 
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In Sri Lanka, her mother worked with the Canadian International Development Aid Group, which 
     contributed to aid projects throughout Sri Lanka. Her father’s entire career was about building
      homes and communities. He had a government job, where he allocated government resources to 
      self-help housing. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Her time in Sri Lanka grew short, however, as a war emerged. She saw the daily violence and
       destruction of her hometown and her family had to flee due to the targets placed on their backs
        from her father’s government job. So, they moved to Bangkok, Thailand, lived in a hotel for
         two months completely off of their savings as it was hard for her parents to find a job. She 
         could not attend school and instead learned English from workbooks her mother had given her.

        Not long after, her family went back to Sri Lanka, but soon moved again due to her father’s
         aspirations to work in developing countries as those were the places where his skillset was
          required. So, they moved to Namibia in Southern Africa. At first, she attended St. Mary’s,
        a school where she felt out of place and isolated. However, she was able to create her own
        community and established the school’s first basketball team. With the help of her teacher,
          she gathered a group of her classmates and taught them how to play the sport.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Then, she switched schools to attend the American International School of Johannesburg, 
          where she was a part of the IB program. After she graduated, she attended the University
          of Virginia, yet another drastic move in her life. She recalls the difficulty she had 
          adapting to American culture, especially when studying architecture and urban planning.

        “I had always measured in the um, uh metric system. Everything I know until— for 18 years has
         been in the metric system. All of a sudden, they’re like, “Oh, do a drawing in quarter scale.” 
         I had no idea what quarter scale means!”
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Later in her career, she was a project manager for the People’s Homesteading Group, working
          with universities like Johns Hopkins and the University of Baltimore, on affordable housing,
          a field similar to her father’s. Ever since then, she has run 47 projects.

      <p>From seeing her parents helping their communities through their careers in her early life,
         to creating one at her school with basketball, to helping communities with her job in project
          managing, Malindi, throughout her life, has found and fostered communities wherever she has 
          lived. She has always valued community, social good, and perseverance as seen by her life 
          story.</p>
