    Antonia is an immigrant to the U.S from Greece. She immigrated at a very young age with her 
    parents from a small Aegean island in Greece to Baltimore. Like many other immigrants, Antonia
     had a dream to work hard and enter the healthcare profession, even as her journey was filled 
     with uncertainty and variability. She faced various language barriers as English was not her 
     first language. She needed to get a tutor for English, which her parents paid for by working 
     extra hours. </p>
    <br/>
    <div class="parallax7"></div>
    <p>Even through these obstacles as well as occasional homesickness, Antonia worked towards her
       dream. Her family preserved Greek traditions and core cultural and familial values for her by
       sending her to Greek Sunday School and church every weekend. Antonia and her sister became a 
       part of the Greek Orthodox Youth Association, remaining close to the culture of her home 
       country.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Even now, years after immigrating, Antonia cherishes values such as hard work and austerity 
       which her parents instilled in her and her sister while they were growing up. She says that 
       she understands diversity better being an immigrant.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Throughout her life, she worked against the odds to fulfill her dream of making a career in 
       healthcare. She was driven to the field due to seeing the scarcity of good health care every 
       time she visited Greece back home in the summers. She eventually studied nursing and obtained 
       her masters in public health.</p>
       <div class="parallax8"></div>
       <p>Antonia ensured that she upheld Greek traditions and culture to continue her parent’s 
        legacy and ancestry. She combined her traditional values with other values she gained while 
        being in America, especially towards the empowerment of women. She is proud to be a nurse in 
        the U.S.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When asked if she would have wanted to stop her family from coming to America, she replied 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Heck no! I love the fact that my parents had guts to come to a different country, start all 
        over, because we were well off in Greece, start all over from scratch, from nothing, and to 
        establish  and create something precious”.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Through her immigration experience, Antonia has retained core values of hard work and 
        austerity she has seen with her parents, and remained close to her religion and culture.
