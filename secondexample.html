  <p>Alex Tsalikhin’s life has revolved around art. He was a talented sculptor, but his 
    opportunities in the Soviet Union in 1985 were not too pleasant. He kept in touch with 
    an American friend, who shared rock albums and pictures from Michelangelo’s sculptures 
    with him. Although the president of the Soviet Union at the time, Gorbachev, created reforms 
    to bring back banned books and newspapers, it still was tough. One time when Alex returned from a trip,
     he had a copy of a Rolling Stone magazine, which put him on the government’s watchlist. 
     Throughout it all, Alex loved Western music and art from the Beatles to John Lennon.

    <p>Alex came to America on May 15, 1990 and he calls it “one of the most important days” of 
      his life. He faced challenges, such as learning English and adapting to the American culture 
      and mindset. But throughout it all, he kept his dedication and passion for art. He worked as
       a freelance sculptor for Lenox and then at a doll company after, where he received several 
       awards for his work. Now, he works as a freelance sculptor for Buffalo Architectural Casting.
        A current project he is working on is a 17-foot sculpture of Saint Michael the Archangel that
         honors fallen law enforcement officers, and it is currently displayed in Patriots and Heroes 
         Sculpture Park in Williamsville, New York. 
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In 2007, he founded his own record label, Trail Records, something unforeseen by him as
          Western rock was inaccessible in the Soviet Union. In 2009, he started another company,
           A-Cast Studio, which is more focused on architecture and sculptures. The company worked 
           on various historic building restoration projects in New York. 
      </p>
      <div class="parallax3"></div>
      <p>His work has been displayed in galleries in New York, Washington, D.C., Paris, Moscow, etc.
        Throughout his immigration journey, Alex has kept his core values of creativity and passion for art and creation.
