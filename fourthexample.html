        <p>Zach immigrated from China to the Bay Area in the U.S with his family, including his 
            parents, younger siblings and grandparents. His family experienced a dramatic change 
            in their lives when they immigrated to the U.S as they dealt with challenges like adapting 
            to a new language, a new environment, and a new way of living.</p>
        <div class="parallax9"></div>
        <p>
            It definitely was not easy. Zach mentions how his father and his family experienced 
            discrimination in the form of both overt racism and commonplace microaggressions. 
            Throughout it all, however, Zack upheld language as one of the main tools to preserve 
            and uphold his culture and heritage. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            “I never felt ashamed of my home culture or the mother language I speak”, Zack said.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Zack’s family also made special efforts to preserve their cultural identity as they tried 
            to assimilate into their new country. Zack's parents took him and his sibling to Saturday 
            Chinese School regularly. Zack describes his traditional culture by saying that it isn't 
            just made up of specific elements, like clothing, food, or spoken language, but rather “at 
            its core, culture comprises the values and practices passed down from generation to 
            generation”.</p>
            <div class="parallax10"></div>
            <p>
                Zack believes that to preserve core values in a culture, it is important to strike the 
                right balance between assimilation and unique cultural tradition. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “To me, finding a balance between assimilation and the preservation of traditional 
                culture is especially important because it allows individuals and communities to 
                maintain their inherited cultural identities while also adapting to a new environment.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Throughout his experience, he has retained his cultural identity and a strong connection to his culture.
